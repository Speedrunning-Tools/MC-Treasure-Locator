# MC-Treasure-Locator
Unafortunatelly, I got word that this is not allowed, **I DO NOT ENCOURAGE TO USE THIS, IF YOUR RUN GOT REJECTED BECAUSE OF THIS, IT'S NOT MY FAULT, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED**

**IM LEAVING THE CODE HERE IN CASE IT'S USEFUL TO SOMEONE**

A script that looks for the treasure location in Minecraft. This looks for the 9 9 location of a chunk.

And no, you do not need a seed for this, only the coords on where you are standing.

# Dowloading Instructions (Windows)
First, you need to have Python 3.x or above to run the file. (.exe file soon!)

Afer you have downloaded Python, go to command prompt and type `python`

If you get this result:

```
C:\Users\Example>python
Python 3.x.x (bunch of other stuff)
```

You succesfully downloaded Python!

If you get a diffrent result, try downloadid Python again, or folow a tutorial on YouTube admireAAA

Now download the Python script [here](https://github.com/Speedrunning-Tools/MC-Treasure-Locator/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)

After downloading, you should be able to duble click the script and boom, you are ready to find the Treasure Location!

# Downloading Instructions (Linux and Mac)
Unaffortunatelly, I have not tested (and have no idea) how to download this on this OS. If you would like to contribute, you can make a PR and I can merge it

Also, if you know how to make an executable on Linux or Mac, please let me know **@icky#2264**. Thank you!

# The Downside of this Script
This script looks for the 9 9 area of the chunk you are standing at. So if you are not in the chunk that the Treasure chest is located at, this is not going to work. If you have the Treasure Map on you, try to be on top of the X mark so you are on the chunk the Tresure chest is at.

# QnA

**Is this allowed?**:

Unafortunatelly, I got word that this is not allowed, **I DO NOT ENCOURAGE TO USE THIS, IF YOUR RUN GOT REJECTED BECAUSE OF THIS, IT'S NOT MY FAULT, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED**

**Will this have a toll on my preformance?**:

No it will not.

**If this locates the 9 9 area of a chunk, cant you do a Script where it find the 4 4 area of a chunk to find the Stronghold Entrance?**:

I actually have a repo for this! Its located [here](https://github.com/Speedrunning-Tools/MC-Stronghold-Locator)
